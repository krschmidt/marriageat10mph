<p> We woke up early and had time for a quick breakfast with John and Trish before we had to head to the airport. We weighed our luggage before leaving to make sure we didn't need to rearrange anything, and of course Kyle and I took the opportunity to weigh ourselves as well. Kyle lost an impressive 20 pounds over the course of the trip! I only lost 8, which was annoying, but when I remembered how much chocolate I consumed it seemed like a pretty good deal overall. </p>

<p> We made it to the airport in plenty of time, and enjoyed overpriced sandwiches while we watched Ice Age near our gate. Eventually we boarded and I got a window seat near the wing. </p>

<p> It was amazing to see the country spread out beneath us, and to think that what had taken us two months to cross was passing underneath us in a matter of hours. </p>

<p>When I wasn't taking in the view, I was reading my new books. Meanwhile, Kyle was conversing with his goldfish... I blame the complimentary drink coupons. </p>

<p> Due to the time change, we landed in Pennsylvania in the late evening, and by the time we made the drive to my parent's house all we wanted to do was crawl into bed. Tomorrow we're having a post-trip party with local family and friends, and then we'll head back to Maryland, finally home again after two amazing months on the road. </p>

<p> We slept in late again and spent the morning doing laundry, starting to pack up, and writing postcards to the people who had helped us along the way. We got exact addresses for most of them, but some, like the police officers who helped us, will have to rely on the postal service's creativity. Good thing many of our new friends live in very small towns where everyone knows each other. </p>

<p> After our lovely lazy day, John and Trish made us a delicious dinner. Their Jillian got married recently as well, so afterwards we talked weddings and watched their DVD. My mom actually had the album that she'd scrapbooked while we were away, so we had photos to share as well. And of course we told stories and answered questions about the trip. It was a fun evening, and I really wish we didn't have to leave Portland and John and Trish already; I feel like our vacation and our time with them just started. But Kyle has to be back for work very soon, so we'll be climbing on a plane early tomorrow. </p>

<p> We're very committed to visiting western Oregon again, however, and sooner rather than later.</p>

<p> Now the real vacation begins. </p>

<p> We slept in late this morning, really relishing it, and then headed into town with my parents to take care of the bike. The friendly guys at <a href= "http://www.bikegallery.com"> Bike Gallery </a> helped us tear down and pack up our giant bike in an electric scooter box so that we could send it home via AmTrak. Then we got a custom made box from the post office and filled it with parts, tools, shoes, and other equipment that we didn't want to stuff into our luggage. We enjoyed lunch at a delicious Italian buffet (though they insulted my mother by offering her the senior citizen discount), browsed briefly in REI, and spent the rest of the afternoon on the deck admiring the spectacular view and Kyle's strange tan lines.</p>

<p> We spent the evening out with our wonderful hosts and their son-in-law and daughter, who is also named Jillian. We had dinner at a swanky place downtown and shopped at the Oregon University bookstore (mostly for my brother, who loves the Ducks). Then we walked the streets of Portland a bit, admiring highrises with windmills, a giant mask, and a sign for our frisbee team's beloved P-Funk. </p>

<p> We were also impressed by the sheer volume of cycling traffic. Cyclists were everywhere, and cars had no choice but to respect them and share the road. Once again, Oregon was clearly a bicycle paradise.</p>

<p> Our ultimate destination was, no surprises here, a baseball stadium. The Portland Beavers, the Padres' AAA team, were facing the Iowa Cubs. </p>

<p> Initially down 3-0, the Beavers rallied to pull off a comeback and ended up winning 6-3. It was a great game and I really enjoyed myself. I also enjoyed a gigantic bag of cotton candy. </p>

<p> I did share some with the kid sitting in front of us, but it was still way more sugar that a human being should ever consume in one sitting. </p> 

<p> Speaking of dangerous temptations, after the game my mother and I demanded that we stop at the world famous Powell's bookstore. It was wonderfully vast, and even though it was close to closing time I still walked out with a pile of books, including <i> Orlando, </i> <i> Ultramarathon Man, </i> and a few travelogues (which I justified as "research.") If we had had more time I may have needed a wheelbarrow to get out of there. </p>

<p> We got back to find that everyone else was asleep and that the view from the deck was just as impressive at night. </p>

<p> It was our last day, and we didn't even really know how to feel about it, other than amazed. Back in Wyoming we would have known exactly how to feel: exuberant, relieved, finally free. But then western Oregon gave us some of the best cycling of our lives, making our push to the finish feel a little less desperate. But even though we were in less of a rush to escape the bike, we were still very driven to finish the trip, to know that we had done it, to have the accomplishment firmly in our grip. As our miles-remaining count got lower and lower this week, I felt a growing sense of relief and confidence, because I knew that even if the bike broke down or one of us got injured we could find some way to make it work for the last few miles. And when we woke up this morning I was overwhelmed by the realization: we were actually going to make it across the country. </p>   

<p> The trip still had a few surprises left for us on the final day. Two of my dad's favorite pastimes are watching minor league baseball and talking to new people, so I wasn't surprised to hear that he'd made friends with a local at a Eugene Emeralds game and told him all about our adventure. I <i>was</i> surprised when we heard that the guy had talked to his friends at a local news station, who would be sending a reporter to interview us this morning. The ready and raring one-man crew showed up at the hotel while we were packing up after breakfast. </p> 

<p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/4478557785/" title="On the News! by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4053/4478557785_03b5e7a8f3_o.jpg" class="pictureCenter" alt="On the News!" /></a> </p>   

<p> He had some trouble keeping track of our wedding, start, and home locations, but otherwise it went well. We answered questions about the trip and rode slowly around the parking lot a few times for the B-roll. It was a fun time, and since no one we know will see the final product it wasn't even stressful. </p>

<p> After our fifteen minutes of local fame, we rode all of five miles (four if we hadn't gotten lost) to the Wandering Goat Coffee Shop, where we grabbed a morning pick-me-up and hung out with our new friends Aaron and Laura. </p>

<p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/4479183476/" title="Pino Friends by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4017/4479183476_39e8757f64_o.jpg" class="pictureCenter" alt="Pino Friends" /></a> </p>

<p> We had suspected that they were our kind of people when we saw that they were riding their tandem to the geographic center of every state, but it was nice to confirm it in person. They were fantastic and we had a great time swapping bike stories and repair tips, and we also asked them all about Eugene, because we're already falling in love with it enough to consider moving here. The job market is tough, of course, but they both managed to land perfect jobs for them: Laura teaches music and Aaron works for Burley, a company that makes bike trailers and other equipment. Best of all, they can both bike to work on Eugene's vast network of bike paths. </p>

<p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/4478557545/" title="Bike Paths by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2744/4478557545_75a2918e48_o.jpg" class="pictureCenter" alt="Bike Paths" /></a> </p>

<p> Soon Aaron had to do just that, so we all climbed on our bikes and saw more of delightful Eugene before parting ways. It was sad to say goodbye to our new friends and their amazing town, but we were very motivated by the signs leading to our final destination, Florence.</p>

<p> I started to feel sick in the strangely named town of Noti, but a break at a convenience store helped somewhat and we continued on down the small highway, passing through swampland followed by forests of very tall trees. </p>

<p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/4479183098/" title="New Tree Varieties by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2798/4479183098_d660ae7fda_b.jpg" class="pictureVert" alt="New Tree Varieties" /></a> </p>

<p> We happened on Morning Glory Farm, where Kyle enjoyed a smoothie and I consumed an entire container of blueberries. </p>

<p> They were delicious. </p>

<p> And have I mentioned that I love riding in forest shade? </p>

<p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/4478557001/" title="Riding Through the Forest by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4014/4478557001_fb902c39cb_o.jpg" class="pictureCenter" alt="Riding Through the Forest" /></a> </p>

<p> It was lovely. Unfortunately the landscape started to look a lot more orange and yellow as we entered a construction zone and the traffic volume picked up. The lines of cones and pylons looked endless, and the flag people were not nearly as friendly or competent as our friends in Wyoming. But Oregon still demonstrated its care for cyclists with a bike warning light in one of the tighter tunnels. </p>

<p> We finally turned off of the road with the heaviest construction onto one with inactive work zones, and we also took the opportunity to stop at a small coffee shop with a great name: Caffeination Station. The decor was cheery, the owner was friendly, and Kyle's new friend was thirsty.</p> 

<p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/4479186410/" title="Coffee Sunshine by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4479186410_03590c0b61_o.jpg" class="pictureCenter" alt="Coffee Sunshine" /></a>

<p> We got back on the road reinvigorated, talking about our plans to move to Eugene someday and singing our Bicycle Fantasy song at the top of our lungs. (Or was that last one just me?) We also wondered whether anyone still lived in the little house on top of the moving bridge. </p>

<p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/4478560437/" title="House on the Bridge by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4001/4478560437_9cbfbf4f84_o.jpg" class="pictureCenter" alt="House on the Bridge" /></a> </p>

<p> My stomach was still bothering me, but it ceased to matter as we got closer and closer to Florence and we got more and more excited. My parents were already there, looking for a place where we could conveniently get the bike to the beach. (They discovered that our original endpoint was actually a cliff overlooking the water, which wouldn't have been the same.) We started a gleeful countdown at each new road sign. </p>

<p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/4478560243/" title="Almost There by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2699/4478560243_e1384cb68a_o.jpg" class="pictureCenter" alt="Almost There" /></a> </p>

<p> My parents found a good place for us to finish, and they insisted on guiding us there themselves, driving ahead and jumping out of the car to direct us at every turn. They may have been more excited than we were. Finally we reached a "Staging Area" along the Oregon Dunes and followed them into the parking lot. A mountain of sand and brush stood between us and the not-yet-visible ocean. </p> 

<p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/4478559619/" title="Mom on the Dune by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4045/4478559619_65cc1fde56_o.jpg" class="pictureCenter" alt="Mom on the Dune" /></a> </p>

<p> We shouldered the bike together and followed my mom up the dune. We struggled forward, whipped by the winds and constantly stumbling. It was a fitting final challenge, really. </p>

<p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/4478559529/" title="Up the Dune by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4478559529_503899aab7_o.jpg" class="pictureCenter" alt="Up the Dune" /></a> </p>

<p> It was probably also fitting that it was unbelievably cold, just like the morning we set out on this crazy journey. As we crested the dune, however, we were glad that it had worked out this way. It was so much more dramatic to suddenly see the ocean spread out in front of us.</p>

<p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/4478559235/" title="Finally by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4072/4478559235_113de6f3dd_o.jpg" class="pictureCenter" alt="Finally" /></a> </p>

<p> We stumbled down the slope like giddy kids and carried the bike to the ocean that we'd been seeking for so long. </p>

<p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/4478558977/" title="To the Water by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2778/4478558977_8d1e618f76_o.jpg" class="pictureCenter" alt="To the Water" /></a> </p>

<p> Unfortunately it was much, much too cold for us to go rushing into the water the way I'd imagined it a hundred times. Instead we dipped the wheel in and ran back as quickly as we could. </p>

<p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/4479184484/" title="Dipping the Wheel by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4059/4479184484_6f89ee907e_o.jpg" class="pictureCenter" alt="Dipping the Wheel" /></a> </p>

<p> I actually ran away a bit <i> too </i> quickly and left Kyle stranded for a moment. Ooops. </p>

<p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/4479184446/" title="Looking for Help by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2710/4479184446_7ae9e78d80_o.jpg" class="pictureCenter" alt="Looking for Help" /></a> </p>

<p> It wasn't quite sunset, so we waited on the beach, shivering together, taking photos, collecting stones and shells, and calling family and friends, though it was hard to communicate with them over the raging wind. If only it had been a little warmer so that we could have enjoyed the beautiful beach and fun dunes. </p>

</p> My wonderful parents stuck it out with us, and my father even braved the water so that he could put his hand in the Pacific Ocean. </p>

<p> We also talked to a vacationing French family, the only other people crazy enough to be at the beach in this weather. Finally the sun was low enough for my mom to take our victory photo, which made us indescribably happy then and every time we've looked at it since. </p>

<p> After the nice riding in western Oregon we had no desire to throw the bike into the ocean (back in Kansas it was a different story) so we lugged it back over the dune and packed it into the car. Then it was off to Portland, where our relatives John and Trish will be hosting all of us for a few days. I had trouble adjusting to riding in a car for an extended period of time; it felt too fast and abrupt after two months of living at ten miles per hour. So I was glad to take a break for dinner at the Steelhead Brewery back in Eugene. </p>

<p> It was fantastic, and I felt much better as we headed into Portland and up the twisting and turning hill road to our friends' home. They were asleep, but they had left a charming celebratory gift for us in the kitchen. </p>
