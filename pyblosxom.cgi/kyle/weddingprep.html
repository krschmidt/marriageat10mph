<h3><a name="thereception-2009-05-24-22-01" href="weddingprep/thereception-2009-05-24-22-01.html" class="titleLink">The Reception</a></h3>

<p>We took Dave's huge car to the reception. As previously mentioned, we refer to it as a boat.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3617168190/" title="We're on a Boat! by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3366/3617168190_ecec6d8b27_o.jpg" class="pictureCenter" alt="We're on a Boat!" /></a>

<p>After finding a little bit of food and drink to hold ourselves over, it was time for everyone to make an enterance. To see those photos, check out the proofs at <a href="http://www.keagyphotography.com/JillianandKyle/">http://www.keagyphotography.com</a>. Everyone entered to a fun, personalized name.</p>

<p>After we sat, it was time for the toasts. Unfortunately, Jillian and I had no liquid in our toasting glasses, so we had to toast with imaginary champagne, which was best, since Jillian doesn't like champagne anyway. Dinner was fantastic, and included a pasta bar, which might be the best invention ever.</p>

<p>Then it was time for the dances. We started out dancing to Billy Joel's "Longest Time", which has been our song since an early date, where we danced to it in an empty parking lot after a movie.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3615358322/" title="First Dance by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3600/3615358322_dbcfb09319_o.jpg" class="pictureCenter" style="width:50%" alt="First Dance" /></a>

<p>Half way through, the song switched to "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley. Yes, we rickrolled our own wedding. We prompty busted out the dance we'd been practicing.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3614539727/" title="Rick Roll! by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3319/3614539727_d4ecf60aa5_o.jpg" class="pictureCenter" alt="Rick Roll!" /></a>

<p>After the parent dances, Lee, Pie, Whopper and Pickle presented us with a special gift. It's best watched as a video.</p>

<center>
<object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Ec8zKNxHGec&hl=en&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Ec8zKNxHGec&hl=en&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></center>

<p>We cut our ice cream cake, which was tricky, since it was frozen solid. We didn't even smear it on each other's faces.</p>

<p>For the bouquet toss, we instead (naturally) threw a frisbee!</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3617270020/" title="The &quot;Bouquet&quot; Toss by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3664/3617270020_6cfdbd5f29_o.jpg" class="pictureCenter" style="width:50%" alt="The &quot;Bouquet&quot; Toss" /></a>

<p>Similarly, I pulled out a frisbee instead of a garter. Unfortunately, my toss was a little off, and I may have broken a wine glass.</p>

<p>Then it was off for a night in the Lancaster Arts Hotel - through we didn't take the bike.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3598751079/" title="Objectives by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3393/3598751079_9846fe7b01_o.jpg" class="pictureRight" alt="Objectives" /></a>

<p>Finally the wedding day had arrived. Though I understand the girls had a longer morning, we went out for breakfast. Afterward, my hotel room checked out and we all went to David's hotel room to watch B rated movies. David and I went out to run some errands, where we discovered that my electric razor had vanished. So David and I drove across town to check the hotel where I'd be the night after the wedding. Unfortunately it wasn't there, so we had to go back to the hotel where we were staying, where I found the razor under the bed in the room I'd checked out of. Razor in hand, my brother could now shave off all of his facial hair.</p>

<p>After getting ready, we went over to the church, where we had more time to spare. We passed the time by holding class. Note to any school administrators who may be visiting: My objectives were posted and I did greet everyone at the door.</p>

<p>But even after holding class we still had more waiting to do. The photographer arrived and we shuffled out to the church garden to take some photos. Look for a link to those photos at the end of this entry. Eventually it was time for Jester, Ryan, and Andrew to usher people to their seats. The rest of us sat around at took photos.</p>

<p>At moments to three, the bells sounded and the groomsmen, the pastor, and I walked in.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I'm lacking a really good picture of Jillian walking down the aisle. However, again, check the link at the bottom of see a bunch of good ones.</p>

<p>Jillian's Uncle Jerry did a reading</p>

<p>There was singing, more readings, more singing, and we actually got married.</p>

<p>We took many, many pictures, including ones of complete extended families. Those took a while. Plus, we had to have a frisbee game.</p>

<h4>Saturday, May 23, 2009</h4>
<h3><a name="daybefore-2009-05-23-22-00" href="weddingprep/daybefore-2009-05-23-22-00.html" class="titleLink">The Day Before</a></h3>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3598676055/" title="Dance Practice II by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3409/3598676055_6b45a844a1_o.jpg" class="pictureLeft" alt="Dance Practice II" /></a>

<p>The day before the wedding was a huge rush. I left the house early, arriving in Lancaster by eight in the morning. After I'd arrived and unloaded the cookies and the bike, it was time to get down to work. First, Jillian and I had to choreograph and practice our dance. We had grand plans for our first dance, but we hadn't had enough time to work them through. After spending about two hours on it, with plenty of interruptions in the middle, we'd finally had a successful run through. That was going to have to be good enough.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3598685269/" title="Carrying the Bucket by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2436/3598685269_5f2ff3cabd_o.jpg" class="pictureRight" alt="Carrying the Bucket" /></a>

<p>One of our principle interruptions was Jester. Jester had been to Men's Wearhouse and had been measured. However, he realized yesterday that his tux was being picked up in Frederick and not in Lancaster. We hastily arranged a plan where David was going to pick up Jester at Harrisburg, drive with him back to Frederick, and then go to Lancaster. This morning, we realized that plan wasn't going to work. Then we saw Jester's second mistake. He had a layover at Dullas. If he'd thought about it ahead of time, he could have changed his flight so that it ended at Dullas, which is right near Frederick. David could have picked him up there, taken him to get his tux, and all would have been good. Due to a shortness in time, we decided that David would pick up the tux and Jillian's father would pick up Jester in Harrisburg. Safety pins would hopefully fix any tux fit problems.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3598685275/" title="Making the Sign by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3348/3598685275_7efc0e8fe5_o.jpg" class="pictureLeft" alt="Making the Sign" /></a>

<p>Jester arrived mid morning, and David arrived some time later. Jester was put to work putting chairs out and picking up ice, and David and Andrew (Jillian's brother) were put to work washing the cars. Unfortunately, we were a little short a hose, so they ended up using a large bucket filled with water. While they were out washing, David's girlfriend helped us out by making a "Just Married" sign for our bike.</p>

<p>After the cars were washed, the sign was made, the chairs were out, the ice was bought, and the dance was choreographed, we had a few hours until the rehearsal. Three of us promptly took naps on the couches in the couches in the living room. There may be a picture of me on Flickr, sound asleep.</p>

<p>Everything went well at the rehearsal, except that we couldn't stop laughing when I was asked if I took Jillian both "in sickness and in health." After six years of frisbee injuries, including months on crutches, it seemed amusing to consider being together in both sickness and health. But the rehearsal was tiring, since we were starving.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3601319453/" title="Groovin' by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3314/3601319453_e910b0d6ee_b.jpg" class="pictureRight" alt="Groovin'" /></a>

<p>Which was fine, since afterward we went back to Jillian's parent's house for dinner. The food was delicious. Afterward some people wanted to take the pino for a ride and it wasn't long before it started to feel like a carnival ride. To see all of those pictures, just click on the bike picture at left and look through the Flickr photos.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3598704709/" title="A Golfing Group by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3379/3598704709_c42dc2ef00_o.jpg" class="pictureLeft" alt="A Golfing Group" /></a>

<p>After dinner it was off to the mini golf course. There were an awful lot of us, so we formed a number of groups. Just like we did in Georgia, my group decided to play challenge mini golf. In this version, various punishments are doled out, depending on how well you play. Before the end, we'd spoken in ridiculous accents, ridden our clubs like horses, used clubs like canes in Broadway shows, spoken only in questions, become tour guides and spoken only like sports announcers.</p>

<p>After golf we all split apart, and half of us decided to have a "bachelor party" by going out downtown. However, since our designed driver was under 21 we ended up at a Damon's Grill by the mall. It ended up being perfect, since it wasn't loud or busy, giving us a great space to relax at the end of a long day.</p>

<h4>Friday, May 22, 2009</h4>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3598676049/" title="David icing cookies by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2426/3598676049_44a6d88d48_o.jpg" class="pictureLeft" alt="David icing cookies" /></a>

<p>Like all frisbee couples, Jillian and I had originally intended to give frisbees out as gifts at our wedding. However, it turns out that:</p>
<p>-Frisbees are expensive to have custom printed<br>
-Frisbees only appeal to the minority of people at the wedding who actually play frisbee<br>
-We have no artistic talent</p>

<p>So we needed another idea. After tossing around a number of different things, we settled on cookies in the shape of bicycles. Thus Thursday and Friday night before cooking making nights. On Thursday I started baking many, many cookies. David helped by both cooking and, incredibly, icing virtually every single cookie. Lee and I ran out and picked up supplies at Michaels to wrap the cookies and the three of us had a big cookie decorating and wrapping festival. All told, we ended up making nearly 200 cookies, though only about half were decorated sugar cookies. There was also that batch where I forgot baking soda. We still ate some of them, but they weren't very good. The rest were delicious.</p>

<p>Not exactly how I anticipated spending the Friday night before my wedding.</p>
