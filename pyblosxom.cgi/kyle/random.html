<p>When I returned to school from my honeymoon I found that a certain science teacher had decided to cover my desk, bookshelves, and filing cabinet with up to six inches of shredded paper. Unfortunately I didn't have my camera with me, so I wasn't able to get any photos of it, beyond a terrible one on my cell phone.</p>

<p>Naturally I couldn't let that go unanswered. After spending a weekend moving Jillian to Maryland, I came into a large roll of pallet wrap. Several hundred feet. I started with her desk.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3591314870/" title="Office Desk by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3594/3591314870_8b94fe33ff_b.jpg" class="pictureCenter" alt="Office Desk" /></a>

<p>Then moved on to her classroom.</p>

<p>I also wrapped her scissors in many, many rolls of pallet wrap, and hung them from her ceiling.</p>

<p>Just for fun, I even left her a note on the board.</p>

<h3><a name="drivebackfromAtlanta-2009-04-06-15-23" href="random/drivebackfromAtlanta-2009-04-06-15-23.html" class="titleLink">I have a Roommate</a></h3>

<p>David, the Best Man in the wedding, finally got his transfer to move to Germantown from Atlanta. We picked the first weekend in April to do the move. I volunteered to help him out, since it is a very long drive from Atlanta to Frederick.</p>

<p>Whopper drove us both after school on Friday to Dullas, which was surprisingly empty. Although we were two men in crew cuts with no luggage and only one way tickets, we weren't searched. This was the start of the best flying experience I've ever had. Because there hadn't been any coach seats available, Dave's company had bought us first class seats. We weren't even boarded before the flight attendant was serving us complementary beverages. I was able to move and stretch the entire flight. Too bad I'll probably never fly first class again.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3419133428/" title="Dave meets Wanda by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3654/3419133428_bceba5513c_o.jpg" class="pictureLeft" alt="Dave meets Wanda" /></a>

<p>We landed at 9:30 and promptly began walking to the exit, since Dave doesn't care for the train. The walk is more than a mile, through something like six terminals. We passed time by criticizing the ridiculous art in between the people movers. Then it was time to pick up the rental car.</p>

<p>The rental car lady offered us a Mitsubishi. Dave was flexible, he said "Sure, we'll just take whatever the reservation was for." We ended up with a "Black Cherry" PT Cruiser, who Jillian named Wanda by phone. We drove to Walmart, picked up some exceptionally large Tupperware containers and some terrible food for dinner, and then went back to his apartment.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3419133086/" title="Dave's Living Room by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3663/3419133086_19996c3f2f_o.jpg" class="pictureRight" alt="Dave's Living Room" /></a>

<p>A few weeks ago, David had made another trip to Atlanta. At the time, he had no idea he was going to be moving to Maryland, so he didn't bother packing anything. However, he was stuck cleaning up some bees. It seems that bees had decided to occupy an entire wall of his apartment. There were still a lot of things in the apartment that had honey on them, which made packing things an incredibly unpleasant experience. If you look very closely at the picture of Dave's living room, you can just barely notice the yellow stain on the wall in the top right hand corner. That's from where the wall had honey leaking through it. </p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3418322315/" title="Bees 1 by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3348/3418322315_27fd65dac4_o.jpg" class="pictureLeft" alt="Bees 1" /></a>

<p>The bees were actually really terrible. It seems the exterminators hadn't quite finished cleaning everything. There were hundreds of bees left by windows and hiding in light features. Nothing alive, but it made for fun cleaning.</p>

<p>Dave spent a little bit of time packing up and I just went to bed. In order to get going quickly, we were up and picked up the U-Haul at 7am. For the next few hours Dave would pack things up and I'd load them into the truck. He only had a 10 foot truck, and I was convinced it was going to be a really tight fit.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3418322937/" title="Dave and the U-Haul by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3345/3418322937_c2d5ab5fff_o.jpg" class="pictureRight" alt="Dave and the U-Haul" /></a>

<p>By noon we were all packed up, which isn't so bad when you remember that he hadn't had an opportunity to pack at all ahead of time. It took us three tries to find the Comcast building, and when we did find it the line was wrapped up in a spiral shape in order to fit everyone. It ended up taking two hours for him to drop his cable subscription, most of it spent waiting in line. We returned to his place, got the U-Haul, and struck out to drop off the rental car and get on the road at last. We arrived at the Avis at 4:10pm to find that they closed at 4. David spent the next thirty minutes on the phone with Avis National trying to find another drop off location on the North side of Atlanta. I finally told him we'd suck it up and go all the way back to the Airport and drop off the car.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3419130672/" title="The Route from Atlanta by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3619/3419130672_c662e8c3c3_o.jpg" width="425" height="383" class="pictureRight" alt="The Route from Atlanta" /></a>

<p>By the time we were done dropping off the car it was almost 6. Dave took the first driving shift. I fell asleep some time after we hit the North Carolina border, only to have Dave wake me back up after Charlotte to ask me to take over driving. I climbed behind the wheel at 11 and drove until about 2:30 when we switched again right after the Virginia border. I slept until the North side of Richmond. If you can count that as sleep, it meant I got about three hours in the truck. Dave got a similar amount. We finally rolled in to my high school, where we'd parked our cars, at 5am. Dave drove a truck and I drove my car onward to Frederick, where we both hit our beds at 6.</p>

<p>We were up again at 9. By noon we'd successfully moved his stuff either into the apartment or into storage. We used the truck to drop off an old couch at Goodwill, then returned it and found lunch. I packed some stuff for a trip to Charlottesville and then we were on the road again.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, right outside of my school I realized that I'd forgotten three or four different things I needed. So though I could drop Dave off to pick up his car, I was stuck driving back to Frederick. I finally got to Charlottesville last night at 8:30 to find a very sick Jillian. </p>

<p>I'd say it was a really terrible experience driving hundreds of miles over night on only three hours of sleep, but that first class place ticket made it all worth it. Plus now I have a roommate who will be staying in my apartment while Jillian and I are out riding across the country.</p>

<p>A few months back Jillian promised me she was going to stop playing frisbee until the wedding. Then Sheila called.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3407019956/" title="Making Dinner by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3476/3407019956_ae1a54afb9_o.jpg" class="pictureLeft" alt="Making Dinner" /></a>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3406210463/" title="David's Huge Watch by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3549/3406210463_1eecc158df_o.jpg" class="pictureRight" alt="David's Huge Watch" /></a>

<p>Sheila currently lives in Spain. She was planning to be back for just one week, which included the weekend of the Gettysburg home tournament. She wanted Jillian to play frisbee. There's no way to understand the Sheila-Jillian frisbee relationship. You really need to see (and hear) it. Jillian invited some friends of her from the UVA Hydras to come play.</p>

<p>David and I enjoy having people around. We decided we'd show off our kitchen skills. I cooked some <A href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Easy-Vodka-Sauce/Detail.aspx">Vodka Sauce</a> Pasta. We even had side dishes.</p>

<p>Like any good frisbee team, most players had nicknames. So it was Ducky and Devo that came to play with Jillian's team. Having two people in the house named Devo was rather confusing at first, but since I had my nickname back when she was still in Middle School, I won. For the weekend she became Devo II.</p>

<p>On a side note, David got a brithday present from his mother. It was a gigantic watch. We half-joked that he could guide ships into the harbor with that thing.</p> 

<p>After making breakfast for everyone, I went up to Gettysburg to watch the games. During the last game, Jillian tried to get a disc but her mark ripped and twisted it away. Jillian dislocated her shoulder. Since this is a regular occurance, I shot a picture.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3406210257/" title="Jillian's hurt! by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3613/3406210257_1f00e4bb7b_o.jpg" class="center" alt="Jillian's hurt!" /></a>

<p>While rolling around on the ground, Jillian actually managed to get it back in the socket, just moments after this picture. She was helped up and sat out the rest of the game. Afterward, Ducky made Jilian a sling.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3406210355/" title="Ducky making a sling by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3443/3406210355_9f2fa9ba04_o.jpg" class="center" alt="Ducky making a sling" /></a>

<p>We all went to a brief picnic where we got a few hot dogs and then drove back to Frederick. Ducky and Devo II took a shower, Jillian and I went to the Immediate Care Center. Fortuantely, the X-ray was good, so we just went home with Jillian in a sling.</p>

<p>We got dinner, and the ladies returned to Gettysburg the next day for Day 2. Jillian, even though she had the opportunity to mark another player in a sling, didn't play at all. Sheila and Friends (the official team name) won the tournament and captured a bubble trophy (I'm still not sure what that is). </p>

<p>Although Dave cooked up a 10lb Ham Dinner, Ducky and Devo II needed to get back to Charlottesville. So after stopping back in Frederick to pick up their stuff, they were on their way.</p>

<p>David and I have a lot of ham left over.</p>

<p>Jillian's arm is starting to feel better, so we should be ok for the wedding. But no frisbee is allowed at the rehersal dinner.</p>

<h3><a name="caffeinefail-2009-03-25-20-00" href="random/caffeinefail-2009-03-25-20-00.html" class="titleLink">Caffeine Fail</a></h3>

<p>So even though my official New Year's Resolution was only to give up Coffee, I thought it would be best to give up all caffeine. I succeeded, mostly. I finally gave in this week and had my first Mountain Dew in several months. I wasn't going to be heading home from school until almost 7 and I needed something just to stay awake. Stupid work schedule making me run back to Caffeine.</p>

<p>Still, it was kind of neat. I had just one 20oz bottle and found myself hyper. That hasn't happened since early in High School.</p>
