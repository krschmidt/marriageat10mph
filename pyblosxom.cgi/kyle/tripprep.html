<p>After spending an entire weekend running around buying things last minute for the trip, we're finally ready to go. We have a lot of stuff.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3640772553/" title="Our Stuff by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3298/3640772553_d82fba9a3f_o.jpg" class="pictureCenter" alt="Our Stuff" /></a>

<p>Around noon we headed off to Lancaster where we'll be leaving our cars with Jillian's parents. After tucking our cars very carefully into the corner of their driveway, Jillian and I got into her mother's car and headed off to Jersey.</p>

<p>I don't remember much of this part of the trip, since I was in and out of sleep a lot.</p>

<p>Once in Jersey we stayed with one of her mother's college friends for the night. We were treated to a delicious dinner and conversation with another Gettysburg alum. Naturally, we had to give rides.</p>

<p>Before we climbed into bed, I noticed the magazine on the nightstand. A hint, maybe?</p>

<p>Plan is to get up at 3:30am in order to make a sunrise departure on the beach.</p>

<p>Our last opportunity to get some training in came in the form of the <a href="http://www.caga.org">Capital Area Greenbelt</a> ride. My former roommate Emily was in town for a few weeks, so Jillian and I put her on my old mountain bike (which I bought specifically for the CAGA 07 ride) and the three of us headed to Harrisburg. By chance we all wore blue.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3616986217/" title="The Blue Team by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2466/3616986217_aa25a238ae_o.jpg" class="pictureCenter" alt="The Blue Team" /></a>

<p>We met up with my family, some of whom were apparently able to avoid being in a picture.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3617807614/" title="Schmidt Boys by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3383/3617807614_a9b3a02a6f_o.jpg" class="pictureCenter" alt="Schmidt Boys" /></a>

<p>This ride was also our first opportunity to try out Jillian's sandals. Jillian's mountain bike shoes had caused some pretty serious hot spots during the Scranton ride, so we were glad these worked a lot better.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3617807106/" title="The New Shoes by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3623/3617807106_1d4247d278_o.jpg" class="pictureCenter" alt="The New Shoes" /></a>

<p>After our rather miserable experience in Scranton, we were glad to be able to get a fun ride in before our trip.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3534564777/" title="Williamsport Overlook by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2402/3534564777_7197e1304b_o.jpg" class="pictureLeft" alt="Williamsport Overlook" /></a>

<p>In order to log some training miles Jillian and I have been doing charity bike rides. Unfortunately, we're only going to get two in before it's time to leave. We did our first one on 4/26, in Scranton, Pennsylvania. As usual, it became an epic journey.</p>

<p>Not only were we going to do the ride, we were also going to take the opportunity to scout honeymoon locations in central PA. One of the towns we passed through was Williamsport. We stopped at the scenic view there, took some photos, and noticed the bike was having trouble staying on the car rack. While my rack is built to hold three bikes, it isn't built to hold one bike as heavy as ours. Plus, we need to mount the bike on the rack diagonally. While this keeps the width of the bike to a minimum, it also puts a lot of stress on the rubber straps. The bike wasn't in any danger of falling off, but I didn't like how it'd been shifting.</p>

<p>We spent the night in New York at my parent's house. My parents and I went down to the rail trail and my mother went on her first bike ride in several years. We had a lot of fun, though it got rather dark.</p>

<p>Sunday morning we left early, and Jillian and I got in the car feeling a little rushed. We hadn't even made it to the PA line when one of the rubber straps popped off the bike. While again, the bike wasn't in any real danger of falling off, it was a bad way to start the day. Between the rush to get going and then the sudden stop, I arrived at the start line feeling very stressed.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageat10mph/3534565083/" title="Scranton by Marriage at 10 MPH, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2260/3534565083_260eb8bac0_o.jpg" class="pictureLeft" alt="Scranton" /></a>

<p>I always forget how much I dislike the starts of charity rides. Every hurries to get there, then waits to get started, and then everybody races each other for the first few miles. It doesn't matter how much you tell yourself you're not going to do it. Once again, I felt rushed.</p>

<p>Then we started having chain problems. Due to our chain problem from the ride the other day, our chain had a tendency to slip off. We were just about to pass a large group of people when the chain nearly wound up on my foot. Not only had we lost the chain, but the boom had gotten twisted and slid in and we'd bruised our legs. It took a number of tries to get everything back where we wanted it. Since we'd lost nearly ten minutes it was impossible to catch most of the people.</p>

<p>So now I'm really stressed. The bad start to the day, now the chain, and now we're the lone bike on this ride, unable to keep up with anyone. Just in time to start a climb.</p>

<p>We were doing route four, which was just over fifty miles long. It had quite a bit more climbing than route three, and it turned out that all that climbing happened at once. We did a seven mile, thousand foot climb in ninety degree heat (in April, in Scanton!), only to turn a corner and discover another hundred feet of climbing over two blocks. That felt straight up. It also just felt mean. Yes, we'd signed on for the challenge ride. Yes we expected some climbing. But that last hundred feet was uncalled for, and not fun.</p>

<p>The worst part might have been that there was almost no downhill! We were expecting several miles of easy downhill. Instead it felt like we got it all at once, and found a stop sign at the bottom. We lost a lot of momentum. We also lost the chain again, and the Pino started to feel very wobbly. We stopped at a bank to fix the chain and look at the wobble, and stopped again not long later. I couldn't figure out where all this wobble was coming from. It wasn't until we were back at the Scranton High School parking lot that I discovered that it was just bad roads. Scranton might have the worst roads I've ever ridden. I swear there was a pothole in Carbondale that would have swallowed most of my car.</p>

<p>Then Jillian started to get some pain on the bottoms of her feet. We're still trying to work out exactly what it is. I'm worried it's the SPD cleat putting more pressure than she's used to, she's worried about a sock problem, and we're both worried about shoe fit. She was in a lot of pain, we won't be able to ride if she's in pain like that often. She graduates the weekend of 5/16. Hopefully then we'll find the time to look into it.</p>

<p>After we returned to the High School I gave my cousin and uncle rides on the Pino.</p>

<p>On the drive back to Frederick, that pesky rubber strap on the rack finally snapped and I spent a long time at the Hershey rest stop figuring out how to tie the straps to the bike just right so that as the bike slid they'd get tighter. It worked, but it was a pain to get the bike off when we were done.</p>

<p>Overall, we learned a lot. Aside from the bike/car problem, we also learned the importance of not being in a hurry. Captaining that bike takes a lot of effort and if I get stressed I get no fun. We did a good job of complimenting each other - when she was stressed I was calm, and the other way around, but we'll need to focus on this next ride. Show up really early to the ride, focus a ton on not being in a hurry during the ride, and just generally not care about keeping up with the regular bikes.</p>

<p>That also means we've learned we're a lot slower than regular bikes. We'll be even slower with a trailer. We're still going to shoot for that 10mph average though.</p>

 on sale for $198 including tax and shipping the other day. Seeing as this is an easy $50 less than I usually see them, I bought it right away. A few notes.</p>

<p>It arrived with 512MB of RAM. This really wasn't enough. It would work, but not if I wanted to launch more than one application at a time. $30 at NewEgg and now it has 2GB of RAM. It feels very snappy.</p>

<p>It runs Ubuntu Hardy LTS. I can understand why Dell would want me to use an LTS version, but I'm a little nervous about changing the software sources over to Intrepid and giving it an upgrade, even though I'd like some of the new software features.</p>

<p>If I enter a WPA key under my login and then give it to Jillian she needs to enter the WPA key all over again. I understand this is how Keyring works, but what a pain. We'll end up using only one login.</p>

<p>The SD Card slot works great.</p>

<p>Jillian has named it Cooper. This is a break from my normal naming scheme of naming my machines after computer scientists.</p>

<p>The apostrophe key is in a really dumb spot - down just to the right of the space bar. I try to type an apostrophe and I end up hitting the enter key. It would help if I had smaller fingers.</p>

<p>It really does run totally silent (and not that hot). I have trouble telling if it's on sometimes. I'd like solid state drives in all my laptops.</p>

<p>There isn't much space on it. Even after removing a bunch of packages I don't need I still have less than 2GB of storage available.</p>

<p>I didn't realize this, but I often rest my right thumb below the spacebar when I'm typing, and use my left thumb exclusively for hitting the spacebar. This is fine most of the time, but it means my thumb gets dragged on the touchpad of the Mini. I think this is why windows sometimes minimize by themselves and the mouse cursor seems to move around the screen randomly.</p>

<p>Still, I'm happy with it. It's easily half the weight and size of my Toshiba. We'll probably buy a collection of SD Cards or USB drives and mail them back to one of our Parents to keep track of as we go. But this laptop should work fine for writing entries on the blog, even if we need to go a little slower until we're used to the smaller keyboard.</p>
